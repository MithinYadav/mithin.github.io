# Churn Prediction Analysis (Guided Academic Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying patterns and predicting customer churn using a combination of SQL for data extraction and Python for predictive modeling. [cite_start]This was completed as part of an academic data analysis program between September and November 2025[cite: 10].

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* [cite_start]**Database:** SQL (Data extraction and structured analysis) [cite: 11]
* [cite_start]**Programming:** Python (Data cleaning and exploratory analysis) [cite: 11, 12]
* [cite_start]**Visualization:** Power BI & MS Excel (Dashboarding and reporting) [cite: 14]
* [cite_start]**Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn (Guided modeling) [cite: 13, 17]

## 📊 Key Activities
* [cite_start]**Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and standardized data formats using Python[cite: 12].
* [cite_start]**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed statistical analysis to identify trends and correlations[cite: 12].
* [cite_start]**Predictive Modeling:** Developed a basic model under guided learning to forecast potential churn[cite: 13].
* [cite_start]**Reporting:** Created interactive dashboards to present insights clearly to stakeholders[cite: 14].

## 📈 Insights Found
* [cite_start]Identified key behavior patterns that lead to customer attrition[cite: 12].
* [cite_start]Simplified complex data into visual reports for better decision-making[cite: 14, 18].
